# Assignment 3

Two Python scripts and two test files were generated. "pdb_fasta_splitter.py" opens two outfiles with a given file handle and generates them as "pdb_protein.fasta" and "pdb_ss.fasta"

"nucleotide_statistics_from_fasta.py" stores the data from a given fasta files in two lists: one for headers and one for sequences. Then, it prints the nucleotide statistics per line.
